A solution to this problem is to model random subjects effects by using the redundant information conveyed by multiple imaging contrasts. In this paper, we introduce a novel analysis framework, where we estimate the amount of variance that is fit by a random effects subspace learned on other images; we show that a principal component regression estimator outperforms other regression models and that it fits a significant proportion (10% to 25%) of the between-subject variability. This proves for the first time that the accumulation of contrasts in each individual can provide the basis for more sensitive neuroimaging group analyzes.", "full_dataset_url": null, "private": false, "add_date": "2015-06-22T11:54:57.479256Z", "modify_date": "2016-01-27T22:00:42.540459Z", "doi_add_date": null, "type_of_design": null, "number_of_imaging_runs": null, "number_of_experimental_units": null, "length_of_runs": null, "length_of_blocks": null, "length_of_trials": null, "optimization": null, "optimization_method": null, "subject_age_mean": null, "subject_age_min": null, "subject_age_max": null, "handedness": null, "proportion_male_subjects": null, "inclusion_exclusion_criteria": null, "number_of_rejected_subjects": null, "group_comparison": null, "group_description": null, "scanner_make": null, "scanner_model": null, "field_strength": null, "pulse_sequence": null, "parallel_imaging": null, "field_of_view": null, "matrix_size": null, "slice_thickness": null, "skip_distance": null, "acquisition_orientation": null, "order_of_acquisition": null, "repetition_time": null, "echo_time": null, "flip_angle": null, "software_package": null, "software_version": null, "order_of_preprocessing_operations": null, "quality_control": null, "used_b0_unwarping": null, "b0_unwarping_software": null, "used_slice_timing_correction": null, "slice_timing_correction_software": null, "used_motion_correction": null, "motion_correction_software": null, "motion_correction_reference": null, "motion_correction_metric": null, "motion_correction_interpolation": null, "used_motion_susceptibiity_correction": null, "used_intersubject_registration": null, "intersubject_registration_software": null, "intersubject_transformation_type": null, "nonlinear_transform_type": null, "transform_similarity_metric": null, "interpolation_method": null, "object_image_type": null, "functional_coregistered_to_structural": null, "functional_coregistration_method": null, "coordinate_space": null, "target_template_image": null, "target_resolution": null, "used_smoothing": null, "smoothing_type": null, "smoothing_fwhm": null, "resampled_voxel_size": null, "intrasubject_model_type": null, "intrasubject_estimation_type": null, "intrasubject_modeling_software": null, "hemodynamic_response_function": null, "used_temporal_derivatives": null, "used_dispersion_derivatives": null, "used_motion_regressors": null, "used_reaction_time_regressor": null, "used_orthogonalization": null, "orthogonalization_description": null, "used_high_pass_filter": null, "high_pass_filter_method": null, "autocorrelation_model": null, "group_model_type": null, "group_estimation_type": null, "group_modeling_software": null, "group_inference_type": null, "group_model_multilevel": null, "group_repeated_measures": null, "group_repeated_measures_method": null, "nutbrain_hunger_state": null, "nutbrain_food_viewing_conditions": null, "nutbrain_food_choice_type": null, "nutbrain_taste_conditions": null, "nutbrain_odor_conditions": null, "communities": [], "relative_path": "collection_658"}
